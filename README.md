# MySQLi
**Time** and **Boolean** based SQLi for **MySQL**,  **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite**

Ideal for those cases in which [sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap) is not working properly

Uses binary search to increase speed ðŸ™‚

Remember to update the relevant parts in the script before using it (search for the comment `CHANGE ME`)
